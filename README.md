## The Project
The Bren School at UC Santa Barbara is a graduate-level environmental science and management program, in which students fulfill a 12-month Group Project to solve an environmental challenge faced by a real-world client, in our case, the World Wildlife Fund. We explored the spatial feasibility of offshore mariculture in Brazil’s Exclusive Economic Zone, and created a web-based tool to predict potential yields and profitability for offshore mariculture of various finfish. This app is the interactive component of our overall thesis project.

## The Creators
Our team consists of 5 master’s students at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara: Anna Calle, Kirby Bartlett, Sandra Fogg, Eva Marrero, and Caio Vianna. We came together as a group with a common interest in marine conservation and sustainable utilization of oceea resources. Our collaborative thesis is in partnership with the World Wildlife Fund in Brazil.
